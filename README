This is a quick and dirty script that takes a qcow2 input file and outputs an OVA
for vSphere

To try it out with an empty qcow2 image:

$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 testimage.qcow2 10G
$ ./generate-ova.py ./testimage.qcow2 ./default_parameters.json ./testimage.ova

It uses the OVA generation code from Image Factory without actually having to
run the full factory workflow.

The output is just a tar file with the VMDK and an XML file in it.  Ultimately
it will likely be simpler and more robust to just use an text XML template and
a bit of python or shell to do the conversion and tar.  However, for now, this
works.
